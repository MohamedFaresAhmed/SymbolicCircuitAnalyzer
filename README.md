\# Symbolic Circuit Analyzer



\## Overview

This project provides a MATLAB-based symbolic circuit analysis tool. It automates the derivation of transfer functions, impedances, and other key circuit characteristics using symbolic computation. The framework is intended to support the design and verification of analog and mixed-signal circuits, particularly high-speed links.



## Features

\- Symbolic derivation of transfer functions between any chosen input and output nodes.

\- Calculation of resistance, capacitance, and impedance at any specified node.

\- Automated computation of poles, zeros, and frequency response.

\- Support for both open-loop and closed-loop analysis.

\- Matrix-based formulation for scalability to larger circuits.

\- Extensible framework for adding new components or analysis methods.



\## Requirements

\- MATLAB R2021a or later (Symbolic Math Toolbox required).

\- Git (for version control).
